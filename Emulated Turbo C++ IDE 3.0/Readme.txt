Note: Few User might get screen which is slightly cropped from sides or from up and down. This is perfectly 
      normal and has been enforced in Emulated Turbo C++ to ensure users to get a proper screen resolution.
      This however can be corrected but may lead to disproportionate graphics especially in Graphics Library.
